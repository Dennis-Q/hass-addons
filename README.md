# Home Assistant Community Add-ons by Dennis-Q

## About

In the Subfolders you can find all my custom addons for homeassistant os (former known as hassio).

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br /> 
Just add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: https://github.com/Dennis-Q/hass-addons

## Add-On List

### httpd-proxytunnel
Apache2 configured for use with proxytunnel over HTTPS: https://github.com/Dennis-Q/hass-addons/tree/master/httpd-proxytunnel

## Support

Please keep in mind, that this software is only tested on x86-64 running on a virtualized Home Assistant installation (previously known as hass.io).
